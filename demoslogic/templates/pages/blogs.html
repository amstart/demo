<h1>Blogs</h1>
<p> Here, I imagine blog posts from the users, allowing them to basically hit the keyboard and write things
down without any constraints whatsoever. Whenever they would make any arguments/statements, they
would be obligated to provide links to the respective items. </p>
<p> Because this site seeks to separate presentation from content,
  there won't be any links linking back to the blog posts. </p>
